Lab Task -1 : Due Jan 29, Friday

Task 1 : To write a C program to generate a set of N distinct random integers. N  is an input from the user (not less than 100000)
Write the following generators.
 
1. Own method: XOR + bit-shift/any other

2. LCG Method: Xn=(aXn-1+b) mod c
Linear Congruential Generator : Xn=(aXn-1+b) mod c
For rules on using LCG: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator

3. Lagged Fibonacci method: Xi=Xi-p*Xi-q  (p, q) are basically called lags


Basic Criteria:
1. Numbers should not exhibit easily recognizable patterns. Some patterns are (not limited to):
a. Falling within same range [0-10] or [0-100] or etc..
b. Having same number of digits
c. Having repetitions or large period

2. Design a statistical test to compare the three generators to demonstrate which one is doing better.

Task 2 (optional) :Write a C program to generate a set of N distinct random strings. 

Grading Criteria:
1. Characters must be printable on screen.
2. Should not repeat strings or characters too many times.

Task: Implement a stack that will store  Integers

Grading Criteria:
1. Show the basic operations: push, pop, display
2. Test for 5 to 10 integers.

Additional Useful Notes
Include a program that checks that the output really does consist of distinct values.
